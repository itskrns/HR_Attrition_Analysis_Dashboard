# ðŸ§  HR Attrition Analysis â€“ Power BI Dashboard

Are employees leaving because of poor job satisfaction? Or are certain departments just cursed? This dashboard dives into the root causes of attrition by slicing the data from every angle possible.

## ðŸš¨ Problem Statement

People are leaving. HR is thinning. If this continues, productivity dips and hiring chaos becomes the norm.

We need to understand why employees are leaving, which departments are at risk, and what differentiates those who stayed from those who didnâ€™t.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze job satisfaction of employees who left vs who stayed
- Compare attrition department-wise
- Identify patterns using slicers like Department, Education, Job Level, etc.
- Help HR zero-in on root causes and prioritize retention strategies
